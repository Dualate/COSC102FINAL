**Personal Security Policy for the Home**  
***Introduction***

- Objective: To outline and define the best common practices for maintaining a defensive and secure posture against potential threats in order to maintain a safe haven at home  
- Scope: Residents of the property, guests and tenants

***Roles/Responsibilities***

- Primary Manager: With myself as the primary facilitator of our online networking needs and the most familiar with the potential dangers we face in today’s world, I take full charge and responsibility for our collective network safety  
- Secondary Manager/Primary Accessor: Parents/adults who organize and finance network structure, maintain unfettered access equal to the primary manager and can authorize other party devices  
- Agents/Actors: Everyone who participates on our network is equally responsible for their own literacy and conduct digitally. We live in the 21st century, and as technology evolves, so does the potential for danger; we must adjust in kind

***Security***

- Physical: Only members of the immediate family have direct, unfettered access to our network. Secondary managers and above have the ability to authorize other party devices (guests, maintenance workers, sitters, etc.) with limited access  
- Digital: Secure most sensitive information offline, digital data secured via passwords vaults or encryption vaults; antivirus/malware subscriptions kept up to date; sensitive digital data backed up, most sensitive data encrypted and kept offline

***Data Classification***

- Confidential: Information relating to individuals is kept at this level (financial information, social security, etc.); every password within the network is kept at this level. Information at this level should only be recorded on paper and shared in person or over the phone  
- Private: Relates to individual information doled out at the user’s discretion (phone number, email, birthdate, etc.)  
- Public: Outward facing data, required in everyday interactions, difficult to keep private (name(s), phone number, residence, etc.)

***Incident Response Plan***

1. Immediate termination of all network traffic  
2. Contact ISP for assistance/forensic investigation  
3. Level-by-level reactivation of network devices, sweeping them for potential compromise, isolating any instance of persistent infection by keeping them off-network

***Awareness Training***

- Periodic meetings to discuss any minor threat attempts/occurrences  
- Frequent antivirus sweeps
